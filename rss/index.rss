This is information age and there is an abundance of knowledge for those who make even the slightest of efforts to seek. According to recent analytics, self-help is the most popular topic on many writing platforms and blogs, even with millions of readers across many platforms, there aren't much of readers who can call themselves productive at the end of the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For around 90% of people, this is mainly because of their habit of procrastination and for the rest, they give themselves excuses that they don't have enough time. What that actually means is that being productive is not just high on their priority list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've myself been one of them and I got to admit sometimes I still am, but not to an extent that my to-dos just stay unchecked for months. I've postponed writing about this post for so long before finally deciding to write something today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will tell you how you can overcome procrastination and I really believe that all of your plans, knowledge and wisdom would be of no use if you don't follow this advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The trick is to just start doing it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know how blunt it may sound but seriously it's the only way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, our minds have an innate tendency to resist change but you can trick it into doing small stuff. Break your task into very small multiple sub-tasks. Commit to yourself that you would be going to do it for even 2 minutes. The aim is to just get the things started because that is the most difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-i-dealt-with-it"&gt;How I Dealt With It&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before finally starting this blog I don't know for how long I've had it in mind about what topics to write about and even the titles of the blog post but it's only now when I'm finally writing it because I decided to just open my laptop and fire up some keys. But no, this does not mean that the first draft of this post was publishing ready. I had to do 4-5 revisions to remove any unnecessary details and refine what could have been said in a better way before finally ending up with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="takeaway"&gt;Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's good to make plans, making lists, and deciding in advance about what you're gonna do but don't dwell too much in finding the Perfect way to do certain things because there's simply isn't a perfect way, it would be a wastage of time and just another form of procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, find the smallest first step that you can take towards your goal and &lt;em&gt;Just Do It&lt;/em&gt;. Everyday.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Thirddd...</title><description>&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/09/Orange-Canyon.jpg" class="kg-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting started is hardest.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/thirddd/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5b9806526cd946276c0b2443</guid><dc:creator>Adnan Khan</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2018 18:16:42 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/09/Orange-Canyon-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/09/Orange-Canyon.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Thirddd..."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/09/Orange-Canyon-1.jpg" alt="Thirddd..."&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting started is hardest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>This Is Second Test Post!</title><description>&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/09/blog-cover.jpg" class="kg-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hard work pays.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/this-is-second-test-post/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5b9805ac6cd946276c0b2441</guid><dc:creator>Adnan Khan</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2018 18:14:17 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/09/blog-cover-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/09/blog-cover.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="This Is Second Test Post!"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/09/blog-cover-1.jpg" alt="This Is Second Test Post!"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hard work pays.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>First Test Post</title><description>&lt;h2 id="finally-after-around-4-5-hours-i-m-able-to-start-writing-here-"&gt;Finally after around 4.5 hours I'm able to start writing here.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/09/mohammad-alizade-631039-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a test image.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/first-test-post/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5b9802156cd946276c0b243a</guid><category>Getting Started</category><category>first</category><category>victory</category><dc:creator>Adnan Khan</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2018 17:58:19 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/mohammad-alizade-631039-unsplash.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;h2 id="finally-after-around-4-5-hours-i-m-able-to-start-writing-here-"&gt;Finally after around 4.5 hours I'm able to start writing here.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/09/mohammad-alizade-631039-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="First Test Post"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/mohammad-alizade-631039-unsplash.jpg" alt="First Test Post"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a test image.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
